#imp Number of Function = $(Codomain)^{Domain}$.
#imp Number of one-one function on Set A = $n!$.
#imp If set A has n elements and set Ð² has m elements, men, then the number of injective functions or one to one function is given by $\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}$
#imp Total number of binary operation from A to A where n(A) = n is $n^{n^2}$.
