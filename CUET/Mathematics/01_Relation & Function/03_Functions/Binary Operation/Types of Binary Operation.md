### Commutativity : 
A binary operation $'\ast'$ on a set $S$ is said to be commutative binary operation, if $a \ast b = b \ast a$ for all $a, b \in S$.
Example-
  The binary operations addition $(+)$ and multipliacation $(\times)$ are commutative binary operations on $Z$. But the binary operations substraction $(-)$ is a commutative binary operation on Z as $3-2\neq2-3$.

### Assosiativity :
A binary operation $'\ast'$ on a set $S$ is said to be assosiative binary operation, if $(a \ast b)\ast c = a \ast(b \ast c)$ for all $a, b \in S$.
Example-
  The binary operations addition $(+)$ and multipliacation $(\times)$ are assosiative binary operations on $Z$. But the binary operations substraction $(-)$ is a assosiative binary operation on Z as $(2-3)-5\neq2-(3-5)$.

### Distributivity:
Let $S$ be a non-empty set and $'\ast'$ and $'\odot'$ be two binary operations on $S$. Then, $'\ast'$ is said to be distributive over $\odot$, if for all all $a, b, c \in S$.
$\begin{equation*} a \ast (b \odot c) = (a \ast b) \odot (a \ast c)\end{equation*}$                                    $[Left Distributive of \ast over \odot]$
$\begin{equation*} (b \odot c)\ast a = (b \ast a) \odot (c \ast a)\end{equation*}$                                    $[Right Distributive of \ast over \odot]$
The binary operation multiplication $(.)$ on $Z$ is distributive over the binary operation addition $(+)$ on $Z$.
