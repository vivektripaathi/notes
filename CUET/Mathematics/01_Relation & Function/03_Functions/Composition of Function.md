#### Function of function

#### Properties if Compostition Function :
- The composition of function is not cummutative i.e., $fog \neq gof$
- The composition of function is associative i.e., i.e., if f, g, h are three functions such that $(fog)oh$ and $fo(goh)$ exists then, $(fog)oh = fo(goh)$
- The compostion of two bijections is bijection i.e., if f and g are two bijective function then $fog$ will also be a bijective function.
- Let $f: A \to B \ , \ g: B \to A$ be two functions such that $gof = I_{A}$. Then, $f$ is an injection and $g$ is a surjection.
- Let $f : A \to B \ , \ g: B \to A$ be two functions such that $fog = I_{A}$. Then, $f$ is a surjection and $g$ is an injection.
- Let $f : A \to B \ , \ g: B \to A$ be two functions. Then,
	- $gof : A \to C$ is onto $\Longrightarrow g : B \to C$ is onto.
	- $gof : A \to C$ is one-one $\Longrightarrow f : A \to B$ is one-one.
	- $gof : A \to C$ is onto and $gof : B \to C$ is one-one $\Longrightarrow f : A \to B$ is onto.
	- $gof : A \to C$ is one-one and $gof : A \to B$ is onto $\Longrightarrow g : B \to C$ is one-one.
