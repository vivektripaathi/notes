- Represented by **-**
- Example:
	- U = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }
	- A  = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
	- B = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }

## Symmetric Difference
- The union of the difference of A-B & B-A.
- Represented by delta.
- Example: 
	- A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
	- B = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }
	- A delta B = {1, 3, 5 } U { 6, 8, 10 }
				{ 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}
