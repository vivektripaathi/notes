- If   A ⊆ B and A ≠ B, then A is called a proper subset of B and B is called superset of A.
- Proper Subset Symbol -> **⊂**
- A = {1, 2}
- Subsets 
	- Proper Subsets
		- { }
		- {1}
		- {2}
	- Improper Subset
		- {1, 2}
- Number of Proper Subset = 2^n - 1.
- Number of Improper Subset = 1.
- Number of Subsets = Number of Proper Subset + Number of Improper Subset
