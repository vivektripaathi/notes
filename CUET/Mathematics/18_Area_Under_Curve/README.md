#trick for eclipse equation
$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\frac{x^2}{b^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ $\Longrightarrow \pi ab\ sq.\ unit$

## Area b/w curve and line

$\int(Upper - Lower)$

## Area b/w two Curves

Area = $|\int_a^b (Upper-Lower)|$
Area = $|\int_a^b (f(x)-g(x))|$

Area of shaded region = $\int_a^b = (f(x)-g(x))dx + (g(x)-f(x))dx$

Area = $|\int_a^b(Right\ Curve-Left\ Curve)|$
Area = $|\int_a^b(f(y)-g(y))dy|$
