# Service Legal Agreement
- An agreement between the CSP and the customers that ensures the minimum level of services is maintained.
- It includes the set of services that the provider will deliver.
- It also includes a complete, specific definition to each of the services.
- Not only that, but it includes the responsibilities of both provider and user.
- Furthermore, it guarantees the level of availability, reliability, and responsiveness to system and application.
- A set of metrics to measure whether the provider is offering that services as guaranteed.
- Specifies who governs when there is a service interruption.
- Describe penalties if services are not met.

## Types of SLA
1. **Customer – based SLA:** This type of agreement is used for individual and includes all services that are needed by client.
   - **For Example:** a telecom service includes voice call, messaging serve, internet service, etc…
2. **Service – based SLA:** This type of contract that includes a common services for all its customer.
3. **Multi – Level SLA:** A multilevel SLA will divide the agreement into various levels that are specific to a series of customers using the service. For example, a software as a service (SaaS) provider might offer basic services and support to all customers using a product, but they could also offer different price ranges when buying the product that dictates different service levels. These different levels of service will be layered into the multilevel SLA.
