# Service Models

## 1. Infrastructure  as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced basis to support various operations.
- Such as networking equipments, devices, databases, and web servers.
- Also known as **Hardware as a Service (HaaS)**.
- Customers are charged by pay-per-use basis typically hours, weeks, months and some are also charged on the basis of virtual space used.
- **AWS, Bluestack, VMWare, etc..**
### Advantages
1. Cost Effective.
2. Cheaper web hosting in comparison to traditional web hosting.
3. Security.
4. Maintenance.
### Disadvantages
1. Limited control over infrastructure.
2. Security concerns.
3. Limited Access.

## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
It is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services over the internet. 
- PaaS services are hosted in the cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Salesforce, Windows Azure, Google App Engine**
### Advantages
1. Simple and Convenient for users.
2. Cost-Effective.
3. Efficiently managing the lifecycle.
4. Efficiency.
### Disadvantages
1. Limited control over infrastructure.
2. Dependence on provider – for availability, scalability, reliability.
3. Limited Flexibility.

## 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
It is a way of delivering services and applications over the Internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software, we simply access it via the Internet, freeing ourselves from the complex software and hardware management. It removes the need to install and run applications on our own computers or in the data centers eliminating the expenses of hardware as well as software maintenance.
- **Office 365, G Suite, Salesforce, Dropbox, etc…**
### Advantages
1. Cost-Effective
2. Reduce Time – from installation and configuration of the software.
3. Automatic Updates.
4. Scalability.
### Disadvantages
1. Limited Customization.
2. Dependence on Internet.
3. Security Concerns.
4. Limited Control over data.

# Deployment Models
## 1. Public Cloud
- Anybody can access systems and services.
- Less Secure.
- The infrastructure in this cloud model is owned by the entity that delivers the cloud services, not by the consumer.
### Advantages 
1. Minimal Investment.
2. No setup cost.
3. Infrastructure management is not required.
4. No maintenance.
5. Dynamic scalability.
### Disadvantages
1. Less Secure.
2. Low customization.

## Private Cloud
- One-One environment for a single user(customer).
- No hardware sharing.
- Protected by the firewall under the supervision of organization's IT.
- Greater flexibility over resources.
### Advantages
1. Better control.
2. Data privacy and security.
3. Support legacy system.
4. Customization.
### Disadvantages
1. Less Scalable.
2. Costly.

## 3. Hybrid Cloud
- By bridging the public and private worlds with a layer of proprietary software, hybrid cloud computing gives the best of both worlds. 
- With a hybrid solution, you may host the app in a safe environment while taking advantage of the public cloud’s cost savings.
### Advantages
1. Flexibility and control.
2. Cost.
3. Security.
### Disadvantages
1. Slow Data Transmission
2. Complex Structure
3. Difficult to manage

## 4. Community Cloud
- Systems and services are accessible by a group of several  organization to share the information within the community.
- Owned and managed by one or more organizations of respective community.
### Advantages
1. Cost effective.
2. Collaborative environment.
3. More secure than public cloud.
4. Security.
### Disadvantages
1. Fixed data storage and bandwidth.
2. Less secure than private.
3. Not for individual organization.
